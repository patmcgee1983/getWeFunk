WeFunk is the longest running and the best funk / hip hop / breaks radio ever!
They have been running for over 25 years and continue to provide the highest quality music

Since no plug in exists for KODI, I may have to make one, but for the time being I used this python script
to download the entire series!

This script will start at first show #,  and go to last show #
For each show it will download the show mp3, and the album art, write the ID3 tags and set the album art

Files will be downloaded into same location as script

All ~1000 shows require about 100GB of space
